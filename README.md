👋 Hi, I’m Alex Patil

Software Engineer • Full-Stack (Backend-First) • Automation & Systems

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I’m a software engineer with hands-on experience building full-stack applications, backend platforms, and automation-driven systems. I work across the stack, but my primary focus is on backend architecture, system design, and building reliable services that operate well in production.

My approach to engineering emphasizes clarity, maintainability, and practical trade-offs over unnecessary complexity.

## Open Source & Engineering Philosophy

I strongly believe in open-source software and the value of well-documented, composable systems.  
I prefer tools and architectures that are:

- Explicit rather than magical
- Easy to reason about and debug
- Designed for long-term maintenance

Most repositories here reflect real-world use cases, platform components, or reusable building blocks.

## Continuous Learning

I continuously refine my skills by:
- Studying system design and distributed systems concepts
- Improving backend performance and security
- Deepening my Go and Node.js expertise
- Exploring scalable frontend patterns with Next.js

---

## Collaboration

I’m open to:
- Open-source collaboration
- Backend and full-stack development work
- Automation and systems engineering projects
- Technical discussions and code reviews

If something here aligns with your interests, feel free to reach out.
