👋 Hi, I’m Alex Patil

Software Engineer • Backend & Automation • Open Source Contributor

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I’m a software engineer with hands-on experience in building backend systems, automation tools, and production-grade web applications. My work focuses on writing clean, maintainable code and solving real-world problems through practical engineering solutions.

I have worked across the full stack, but my primary interests lie in backend architecture, microservices, automation, and system reliability.

🔍 Open Source & Engineering Philosophy

I strongly believe in open-source software and simple, well-documented systems.  
I prefer tools that are:
- Explicit rather than magical
- Easy to reason about
- Designed for long-term maintenance

Most of my public repositories are experiments, building blocks, or production-inspired services intended to be reused and improved.
